# Restaurant-Table-Management-and-Order-System

This C program implements a comprehensive restaurant table management and order system. It allows restaurant staff to manage table reservations, take orders, and generate bills through a user-friendly command-line interface. The system handles both table reservations and walk-in occupancies, and it can track and display orders for each table. Additionally, customers can provide feedback, which is stored and displayed for review.
